# C-Partners
 A repository dedicated to our progress in programming
## Rules
* The main language used in this repository is going to be python, but we are open to receive any other language such as: R, C++ and many others.
* if any of the C-Partners don't show up to the meeting, it would recieve a kind of a punishment (something that hurts, e.g. delete an album of your favourite videos or pay to C-Partner certain amount of money).
